# .bashrc

Package management aliases are included for both pacman (Arch) and apt (Debian/Ubuntu).

# .config/ranger

A single pane config with no image previews.

# .vimrc

For plug-ins, I use [vim-plug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDv9iPv_8R4).

The only plug-in I have installed right now is [Conqueror of Completion](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Install-coc.nvim).
