# .bashrc

Package management aliases are included for both pacman (Arch) and apt (Debian/Ubuntu).

# .config/ranger

A single pane config with no image previews.

# .config/alacritty/alacritty.yml

Alacritty is a great terminal emulator, and you don't need a separate GPU to take advantage of it.

# .vimrc

For plug-ins, I use [vim-plug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDv9iPv_8R4).

The only plug-in I have installed and configured right now is [Conqueror of Completion](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Install-coc.nvim).

# .emacs

A very minimal emacs config which does the following :

* sets up melpa packages
* enables the solarized light theme
* enables relative line numbering
* disables automatic back-up file creation
* disables the annoying beep alerts
