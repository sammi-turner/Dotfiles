# .bashrc

Package management aliases are included for both pacman (Arch) and apt (Debian/Ubuntu).

My config is quite bulky, but feel free to remove any unused environment variables or aliases that you don't need.

# .emacs

WARNING : Loading this config up may trigger an error message about certain packages not being installed.

To fix that problem, install those named packages using META-x, RETURN, package-install, RETURN, followed by the name of the missing package and RETURN again.

This config puts the back-up files that Emacs creates by default, into a .backup directory in the home folder.

In this config, META is set to the Super key. The ESC key also works as a spare META.

To cancel any command, use CTRL-g.

When configuring via the GUI, don't forget to select "save" under "options" to preserve the changes.

# .config/ranger

A single pane config with no image previews.

# .vimrc

My current .vimrc consists of only five lines.

The four vim packages I have installed on my system are from the Arch repos.

```
vim
vim-runtime
vim-airline
vim-airline-themes
```

For plug-ins, I use [vim-plug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDv9iPv_8R4).

The only vim plug-in I have installed right now is [Conqueror of Completion](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Install-coc.nvim).

# dracula.xml

This colourscheme can be added to Gedit via the editor itself.
